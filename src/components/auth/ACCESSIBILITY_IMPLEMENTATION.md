# Accessibility Implementation Summary

## Task 7: Implement Accessibility Features

This document summarizes the accessibility features implemented for the modal signin component according to the task requirements.

### Requirements Met

#### ✅ Add proper ARIA labels and roles for modal elements

**Modal Container:**

- `role="dialog"` - Identifies the modal as a dialog
- `aria-modal="true"` - Indicates this is a modal dialog
- `aria-labelledby="signin-modal-title"` - References the modal title
- `aria-describedby="signin-modal-description"` - References the modal description

**Form Elements:**

- `role="form"` - Identifies the signin form
- `aria-label="Google 로그인 폼"` - Provides accessible name for the form
- `role="group"` - Groups related action buttons
- `aria-label="로그인 재시도 및 대안 옵션"` - Describes button groups

**Error Handling:**

- `role="alert"` - Identifies error messages as alerts
- `aria-live="assertive"` - Ensures errors are announced immediately
- `aria-atomic="true"` - Announces entire error message as one unit
- `id="signin-error-message"` - Provides ID for error association
- `aria-describedby="signin-error-message"` - Associates errors with form controls

**Icons and Decorative Elements:**

- `aria-hidden="true"` - Hides decorative icons from screen readers
- `focusable="false"` - Prevents SVG icons from receiving focus

#### ✅ Implement focus management to trap focus within modal when open

**Enhanced Focus Management Hook:**

```typescript
function useFocusManagement(
  isOpen: boolean,
  modalRef: React.RefObject<HTMLDivElement>
)
```

**Features:**

- Stores previously focused element before modal opens
- Identifies all focusable elements within modal
- Implements comprehensive focus trapping with Tab/Shift+Tab
- Restores focus to previously focused element when modal closes
- Handles edge cases (no focusable elements, single element)

**Focus Trapping Logic:**

- Tab key moves focus forward through focusable elements
- Shift+Tab moves focus backward through focusable elements
- Focus wraps from last element to first (and vice versa)
- Focus is contained within modal boundaries

#### ✅ Add screen reader announcements for modal state changes

**Screen Reader Announcement Component:**

```typescript
function ScreenReaderAnnouncement({
  message,
  priority = 'polite',
}: {
  message: string
  priority?: 'polite' | 'assertive'
})
```

**Features:**

- `aria-live` regions for dynamic content announcements
- Support for both 'polite' and 'assertive' priorities
- `aria-atomic="true"` for complete message reading
- `aria-relevant="additions text"` for relevant changes

**State Change Announcements:**

- Modal opening: "로그인 모달이 열렸습니다. ESC 키를 누르거나 배경을 클릭하여 닫을 수 있습니다."
- ESC key pressed: "ESC 키를 눌러 모달을 닫습니다"
- Authentication success: "로그인이 성공했습니다. 모달을 닫습니다"
- Authentication error: "로그인 중 오류가 발생했습니다"
- Focus changes: Announces when focus is set to specific elements

#### ✅ Ensure keyboard navigation works properly with tab order and ESC key handling

**Keyboard Event Handling:**

```typescript
const handleKeyDown = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
  // Handle ESC key for modal dismissal
  if (e.key === 'Escape') {
    setAnnouncement('ESC 키를 눌러 모달을 닫습니다')
    setAnnouncementPriority('assertive')
    handleClose()
    return
  }

  // Handle focus trapping
  trapFocus(e)
}
```

**Features:**

- ESC key closes modal with screen reader announcement
- Tab key navigation with proper focus trapping
- Enter and Space key support for button activation
- Proper event prevention to avoid default browser behavior

**Close Button Enhancement:**

```typescript
onKeyDown={(e) => {
  if (e.key === 'Enter' || e.key === ' ') {
    e.preventDefault()
    handleClose()
  }
}}
```

### Additional Accessibility Enhancements

#### Focus Indicators

- Added `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500 focus:ring-offset-2` classes
- Visible focus indicators for all interactive elements
- High contrast focus rings for better visibility

#### Button Accessibility

- Comprehensive `aria-label` attributes for all buttons
- Context-aware labels (e.g., "로그인 다시 시도. 2회 남음")
- Proper button roles and states

#### Error Message Accessibility

- Error messages associated with form controls via `aria-describedby`
- Immediate announcement of errors with `aria-live="assertive"`
- Clear error descriptions with retry count information

#### Loading State Accessibility

- `aria-live="polite"` for loading state announcements
- Proper loading indicators with screen reader support
- Disabled state management during loading

### Modal Error Boundary Accessibility

Enhanced the modal error boundary with:

- `role="alert"` for error announcements
- Proper ARIA labeling for error dialog
- Focus management within error state
- Accessible retry and fallback options

### Testing and Validation

Created comprehensive accessibility tests covering:

- ARIA attributes validation
- Focus management testing
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader announcement testing
- Error handling accessibility

### Browser Compatibility

The implementation uses standard ARIA attributes and DOM APIs that are supported across:

- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Mobile accessibility tools

### Compliance Standards

This implementation follows:

- WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines
- WAI-ARIA 1.2 specifications
- HTML5 accessibility best practices
- React accessibility patterns
