# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements parallel routing combined with interceptor routing for the auth/signin functionality. The goal is to provide a seamless user experience where users can access the signin page both as a full page and as a modal overlay when navigating from other pages, without losing the current page context.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user browsing the application, I want to be able to sign in through a modal overlay so that I don't lose my current page context and can continue where I left off after authentication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks a signin link from any page THEN the system SHALL display the signin form in a modal overlay
2. WHEN the modal is displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain the current page content in the background
3. WHEN a user closes the modal without signing in THEN the system SHALL return to the original page state
4. WHEN a user successfully signs in through the modal THEN the system SHALL close the modal and refresh the current page with authenticated state

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user accessing the signin URL directly, I want to see the signin page as a full page so that I have a dedicated authentication experience when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates directly to /auth/signin THEN the system SHALL display the signin page as a full page
2. WHEN a user refreshes the signin page THEN the system SHALL maintain the full page layout
3. WHEN a user bookmarks the signin URL THEN the system SHALL display the full page when accessed later
4. WHEN a user shares the signin URL THEN the system SHALL display the full page for the recipient

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the parallel and interceptor routing to be properly structured so that the codebase remains maintainable and follows Next.js best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing parallel routing THEN the system SHALL use @modal slot convention
2. WHEN implementing interceptor routing THEN the system SHALL use (.) prefix for same-level interception
3. WHEN organizing the file structure THEN the system SHALL maintain clear separation between full page and modal implementations
4. WHEN handling routing logic THEN the system SHALL ensure proper fallback behavior for unsupported scenarios

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the signin functionality to work consistently regardless of how I access it so that I have a reliable authentication experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN signing in through either modal or full page THEN the system SHALL use the same authentication logic
2. WHEN form validation occurs THEN the system SHALL display consistent error messages in both contexts
3. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL handle redirects appropriately for each context
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide consistent error handling in both modal and full page views

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user on mobile devices, I want the signin experience to be optimized for my screen size so that I can easily authenticate regardless of the access method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing signin on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide responsive design for both modal and full page
2. WHEN the modal is displayed on small screens THEN the system SHALL ensure proper touch interactions
3. WHEN keyboard navigation is used THEN the system SHALL maintain proper focus management in both contexts
4. WHEN screen orientation changes THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout appropriately
