# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Set up parallel routing structure and root layout enhancement
  - Modify src/app/layout.tsx to accept and render the @modal parallel slot
  - Create src/app/@modal directory structure for parallel routing
  - Create src/app/@modal/default.tsx to provide empty default content for the modal slot
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 2. Create interceptor routing for signin modal
  - Create src/app/@modal/(.)auth/signin directory structure for route interception
  - Implement src/app/@modal/(.)auth/signin/page.tsx to handle intercepted signin requests
  - Configure proper route interception to capture signin navigation from other pages
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 3.2_

- [x] 3. Implement modal container component
  - Create src/components/auth/signin-modal.tsx component for modal UI structure
  - Implement modal backdrop, container styling, and close button functionality
  - Add keyboard navigation support (ESC key handling) and focus trapping
  - Implement responsive design for mobile devices with proper touch interactions
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 4. Enhance signin form for modal context
  - Modify src/components/auth/signin-form.tsx to accept isModal prop and context-aware behavior
  - Implement modal-specific success callbacks and redirect handling
  - Add onSuccess callback prop to handle modal dismissal after successful authentication
  - Ensure consistent error handling works in both modal and full page contexts
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 1.4_

- [x] 5. Implement modal state management and navigation
  - Add router.back() functionality for modal dismissal to return to previous page
  - Implement proper URL parameter handling for callbackUrl in modal context
  - Add logic to preserve scroll position and page state when modal is displayed
  - Handle authentication success redirects appropriately for modal vs full page context
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4, 4.3_

- [x] 6. Add error handling and fallback mechanisms
  - Implement error boundary component specifically for modal context
  - Add graceful degradation logic to fall back to full page signin if modal fails
  - Create retry mechanisms for failed authentication attempts in modal
  - Ensure error messages display consistently in both modal and full page contexts
  - _Requirements: 4.2, 4.4_

- [ ] 7. Implement accessibility features
  - Add proper ARIA labels and roles for modal elements
  - Implement focus management to trap focus within modal when open
  - Add screen reader announcements for modal state changes
  - Ensure keyboard navigation works properly with tab order and ESC key handling
  - _Requirements: 5.4_

- [ ] 8. Create comprehensive test suite
  - Write unit tests for modal component rendering and event handling
  - Create integration tests for route interception and parameter passing
  - Implement tests for authentication flow in both modal and full page contexts
  - Add tests for error handling and fallback scenarios
  - Write accessibility tests for focus management and keyboard navigation
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 9. Optimize performance and bundle size
  - Implement code splitting for modal components to load on demand
  - Add proper caching headers and optimization for modal assets
  - Ensure minimal JavaScript overhead for modal functionality
  - Test and optimize modal rendering performance across different devices
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2_

- [ ] 10. Final integration and testing
  - Test complete user flows from different entry points (direct navigation vs intercepted)
  - Verify that existing full page signin functionality remains unchanged
  - Test cross-browser compatibility and mobile device behavior
  - Perform end-to-end testing of authentication success and failure scenarios
  - Validate that all requirements are met through comprehensive testing
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_
