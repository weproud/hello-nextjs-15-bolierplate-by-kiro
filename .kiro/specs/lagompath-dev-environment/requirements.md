# Requirements Document

## Introduction

프로젝트의 완전한 개발 환경 구성을 위한 요구사항입니다. 현재 기본적인 Next.js 15 + Tailwind CSS 4.0
설정에서 시작하여, 현대적이고 확장 가능한 풀스택 웹 애플리케이션 개발 환경을 체계적으로 구성합니다.
이 환경은 타입 안전성, 코드 품질, 성능 최적화, 그리고 개발자 경험을 중시합니다.

2. WHEN querying data THEN Prisma SHALL generate TypeScript types automatically
3. WHEN connecting to database THEN PostgreSQL SHALL be used as the primary database
4. WHEN performing CRUD operations THEN all database queries SHALL be type-safe
5. WHEN database schema changes THEN migrations SHALL be generated and applied safely

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want secure authentication system, so that users can safely sign
in and access protected resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users sign in THEN NextAuth.js 5.0 SHALL handle authentication with Google OAuth
2. WHEN managing sessions THEN JWT strategy SHALL be used for session management
3. WHEN storing user data THEN Prisma adapter SHALL integrate with the database
4. WHEN accessing protected routes THEN authentication SHALL be verified server-side
5. WHEN handling auth errors THEN appropriate error messages SHALL be displayed

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want type-safe state management and form handling, so that I can
manage application state and user input reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing global state THEN Zustand SHALL provide type-safe stores with persistence
2. WHEN handling forms THEN React Hook Form SHALL integrate with Zod for validation
3. WHEN validating input THEN client-side and server-side validation SHALL match
4. WHEN form errors occur THEN appropriate error messages SHALL be displayed
5. WHEN state changes THEN DevTools SHALL be available for debugging

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want type-safe server actions, so that I can handle server-side
operations with full type safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating server actions THEN next-safe-action SHALL provide type-safe action handlers
2. WHEN validating server input THEN Zod schemas SHALL be used for input validation
3. WHEN handling server errors THEN appropriate error responses SHALL be returned
4. WHEN actions succeed THEN cache revalidation SHALL occur automatically
5. WHEN debugging actions THEN error logging SHALL be comprehensive

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-organized project structure, so that I can navigate
and maintain the codebase efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing code THEN the project SHALL follow Next.js 15 App Router conventions
